### Realistic Course Progression (Based on Actual Student Data)

*Note: The official sequence above assumes students are ready for Calculus I in their first semester. Many students may need to take prerequisite math courses first.*

#### Freshman Year - Alternative Path (for students needing math preparation)
**Fall Semester:**
- COSC 111: Intro to Computer Science I (4)
- ENGL 101: Freshman Composition I (3)
- MATH 113: Intro to Math Analysis I (4) - prerequisite for Calculus
- ORNS 106: Freshman Orientation (1)
- General Education course (3)
Total: 15 credits

**Spring Semester:**
- COSC 112: Intro to Computer Science II (4)
- MATH 241: Calculus I (4) - after completing MATH 113
- MHTC 103: Intro to Group Dynamics (3) - SB requirement
- General Education course (3)
Total: 14 credits

#### Sophomore Year - Alternative Path
**Fall Semester:**
- COSC 220: Data Structures & Algorithms (4)
- COSC 241: Computer Systems & Digital Logic (3)
- ENGL 102: Freshman Composition II (3)
- MATH 114: Intro to Math Analysis II (4) - complementary studies
Total: 14 credits

**Spring Semester:**
- COSC 281: Discrete Structures (3)
- MATH 242: Calculus II (4)
- General Education courses (6)
Total: 13 credits

#### Key Differences from Official Sequence:
1. **Math Prerequisites**: Many students need MATH 113 before MATH 241 (Calculus I)
2. **Flexible Scheduling**: Courses can be taken across different semesters based on availability
3. **Summer Options**: Summer and winter mini-mesters can help with scheduling
4. **Course Failures**: Students may need to retake courses, affecting the timeline
5. **Credit Load Management**: Some students prefer lighter loads (12-15 credits) vs. heavier loads (18+ credits)
